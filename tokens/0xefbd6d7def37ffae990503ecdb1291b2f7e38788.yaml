  While EOS has developed a powerful infrastructure for Blockchain Applications, the
  Governance Structure and Block Producer ownership model leads to highly manipulated
  compensation and hinders development of the EOS community. Evolution is a community driven adaptation of the EOS open source software.
  Evolution structures votes and evenly distributes tokens to ensure true decentralization.
